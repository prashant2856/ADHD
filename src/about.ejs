            <h4 class="adhd-about-subtitle">
              Here at ADHDme our primary aim is to create a convenient and quick
              diagnosis for adults who think they may have ADHD.
            </h4>
            <p class="adhd-about-info">
              We have teamed up with psychiatrists in the UK who specialise in
              ADHD diagnosis and treatment. There are a range of doctors
              available on our platform, to cater to your convenience, as we are
              available 7 days a week (including evenings).
            </p>
            <p class="adhd-about-info">
              In todays fast paced world, we understand that many of us do not
              have the time to think about our mental health which may have a
              negative impact in the long term. To make ADHD diagnosis more
              accessible, we operate completely online. You can see some of the
              benefits of our online portal:
